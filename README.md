### Project Goal
We want to have a way for hackers to reach out to mentors during the hackathon. This would involve, at the very least, having a Slack integration that allows hackers to request help (what they need help on, where they are located, etc.) and a way for mentors to accept an incoming help request. Sort of like Uber for mentorship.
